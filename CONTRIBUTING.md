# Contributing to [punchtime.io](https://punchtime.io)

Thanks for your interest in helping with the development of the web client of üëä‚è∞!

This document is here, so you can get some clarity in how it is structured.

## Does something not work like you want it?

First search in the [issues](https://github.com/punchtime/web/issues) if it isn't already reported. Then add your issue with details of what the expected behaviour would be, and what the behaviour is now.

## Do you want to add some code yourself?

Local development of the web client is done with `scss`, `pug`(`jade`), `gulp` and `browser-sync`. To get a correct build, you should run:

```
npm install
gulp
```

or if you want to have a local server: `gulp watch`.

Please add a meaningful commit message and a clear explanation in your pull requests.
